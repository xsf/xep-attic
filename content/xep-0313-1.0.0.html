       Introduction<a class="anchor-link" href="#intro"><abbr title="Link to this point in the document">¶</abbr></a></h2>
  <p class="" style="">It is a common desire for users of XMPP to want to store their messages in a central archive
  on their server. This feature allows them to record conversations that take place on clients that do not
  support local history storage, to synchronise conversation history seamlessly between
  multiple clients, to read the history of a MUC room, or to view old items in a pubsub node.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">2.
       Requirements<a class="anchor-link" href="#requirements"><abbr title="Link to this point in the document">¶</abbr></a></h2>
  <p class="" style="">As this extension aims to make things easy for client developers, some research was made into the
  way clients handle history today. The resulting protocol was designed to allow for the following primary
  usage scenarios:</p>
  <ul class="" style="">
    <li class="" style="">Automatic history synchronization between multiple clients.</li>
    <li class="" style="">Calendar-based on-demand display of historic messages in a client that doesn't keep local history.</li>
    <li class="" style="">So-called 'infinite' scrollback, whereby a client automatically fetches and displays historical messages
    naturally in the message log as the user scrolls back in time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="" style="">Another extension for archiving already exists in XMPP, <span class="ref" style=""><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0136.html">Message Archiving (XEP-0136)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idm168">1</a>]). However implementation experience has
  shown that the protocol defined therein supports rather more functionality than is typically needed for the
  above uses, and is significantly more effort to implement.</p>
  <p class="" style="">This specification aims to define a much simpler and modular protocol for working with a server-side
  message store. Through this it is hoped to boost implementation and deployment of archiving in XMPP. It
  should be noted that (although not required) a server is free to implement XEP-0136 alongside this
  protocol if it so chooses, though a mapping between both protocols is beyond the scope of this specification.</p>
  <p class="" style="">Notable functionality in XEP-0136 that is intentionally not defined by this specification for simplicity:</p>
  <ul class="" style="">
    <li class="" style="">Support for 'collections'. Few clients even support this concept for local history storage, and
    it is possible to apply the logic for splitting a stream of messages into conversations on the
    client-side, thus greatly simplifying the protocol.</li>
    <li class="" style="">Support for uploading to the archive. On the assumption that a server automatically archives
    messages to and from the client, it is typically rare for a client to end up with messages that are
    not already in the archive. Uploading could be useful for bootstrapping an empty archive however, and
    may be defined in a future specification if there is demand for such functionality.</li>
    <li class="" style="">Support for 'off the record' chats (OTR; not to be confused with the encryption algorithm of
    the same name). This allowed complex negotiation for either the user or contact to command specific
    conversations to bypass the archive. In reality the archiving behaviour of a contact's server cannot
    be enforced (they could ignore the OTR request and archive the messages anyway without your consent)
    so this specification does not try and regulate that. Equivalent functionality can be implemented with
    server logic for not including encrypted or specially-tagged messages in the archive (out of scope for
    this specification).</li>
    <li class="" style="">Support per-session configuration. This feature was deemed unnecessary for the majority of
    implementations, and hence the configuration protocol in this specification is much simplified,
    which allows for a simple user interface in clients. Advanced configuration however may be performed
    through ad-hoc commands depending on the server implementation.</li>
  </ul>
<h2 id="archives">3.
       Message archives<a class="anchor-link" href="#archives"><abbr title="Link to this point in the document">¶</abbr></a></h2>
	<p class="" style="">An archive contains a collection of messages relevant to a particular XMPP address, e.g. a user, MUC, pubsub node, server. Note: while a service might have many "archives" as defined here (one per JID capable of being queried) this is a conceptual distinction,
	and a server is not bound to any particular implementation or arrangement of data stores.</p>
	<p class="" style="">Exactly which messages a server archives is up to implementation and deployment policy,
        but it is expected that all messages that hold meaningful content, rather than state changes such as Chat State Notifications, would be archived. Rules are specified later in this document.</p>
    <p class="" style="">A stored message consists of at least the following pieces of information:</p>
    <ul class="" style="">
            <li class="" style="">A timestamp of when the message was sent (for an outgoing message) or received (for
            an incoming message).</li>
            <li class="" style="">The remote JID that the stanza is to (for an outgoing message) or from (for an
            incoming message).</li>
            <li class="" style="">A server-assigned UID that MUST be unpredictable and unique within the archive.</li>
            <li class="" style="">The message stanza itself. The entire original stanza SHOULD be stored, but at a minimum only the &lt;body/&gt; tag MUST
                be preserved (ie. the server might, at its discretion, strip certain extensions from messages before storage), in
                addition to all standard attributes of the stanza (e.g. to, from, type, id).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="" style="">Note that 'incoming' and 'outgoing' messages are viewed within the context of the archived JID, rather than the system as a whole. For example, if romeo@montegue.lit sent a message to juliet@capulet.lit, it would be an outgoing message in the context of archiving for Romeo, and an incoming message in the context of archiving for Juliet.</p>
    <div class="indent"><h3 id="archive_order">3.1 Order of messages<a class="anchor-link" href="#archive_order"><abbr title="Link to this point in the document">¶</abbr></a></h3>
    <p class="" style="">Order within the archive MUST be preserved, where the order of messages is the same as the order that the client originally received them (or would have received them if online). Throughout this document the term 'chronological order' refers to this order, however implementors should take care not to rely on timestamps alone for
    ordering messages, as multiple messages may share the same timestamp.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="indent"><h3 id="archives_deletion">3.2 Message retention and deletion<a class="anchor-link" href="#archives_deletion"><abbr title="Link to this point in the document">¶</abbr></a></h3>
	    <p class="" style="">A server MAY impose limits on the size of an individual archive. For example a server might begin
		to discard old messages once the archive reaches a certain size, or only keep messages until they
		reach a certain age. Any such deleted messages MUST be the oldest in the archive, i.e. it is not permitted
		to create gaps or "holes" in the archive. The UIDs of deleted messages MUST NOT be reused for new messages.</p>

		<p class="" style="">However a server that wishes to remove messages from the middle of an archive, e.g. to remove accidentally transmitted
                sensitive information may omit the &lt;message&gt; stanza from inside the &lt;forwarded&gt; element or replace the
                message with  an appropriate placeholder when transmitting the result in response to a query. However servers
                MUST retain the UID, timestamp and JID of the original message internally to ensure that all queries remain consistent.
                It should also be understood that clients maintaining their own local copy of the archive may still retain the original
                message locally in this case, and this protocol provides no mechanism for forcibly removing messages from any local archive
                or cache that clients may keep.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="indent"><h3 id="archives_id">3.5 Communicating the archive ID<a class="anchor-link" href="#archives_id"><abbr title="Link to this point in the document">¶</abbr></a></h3>
		<p class="" style="">When a message is archived, the server MUST add an &lt;stanza-id/&gt; element as defined in <span class="ref" style=""><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0359.html">Unique and Stable Stanza IDs (XEP-0359)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idm205">2</a>] to the message, which informs the recipient of where and under what ID the message is stored. When doing this the server MUST follow the business rules defined in XEP-0359. The 'by' attribute MUST be set to the address of the archive. For regular users that’s the bare JID of the account and for MUC that’s the bare JID of the room.</p>
		<p class="" style="">Servers MUST NOT include the &lt;stanza-id/&gt; element in messages addressed to JIDs that do not have permissions to access the archive, such as a users’s outgoing messages to their contacts.

<h2 id="query">4.
       Querying an archive<a class="anchor-link" href="#query"><abbr title="Link to this point in the document">¶</abbr></a></h2>
        <p class="" style="">An entity is able to query (subject to appropriate access rights) an archive for all messages within a certain timespan, optionally
        restricting results to those to/from a particular JID. To allow limiting the results or paging
        through them a client may use <span class="ref" style=""><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0059.html">Result Set Management (XEP-0059)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idm218">4</a>], which MUST be supported by both the client and the server.</p>
        <p class="" style="">A query consists of an &lt;iq/&gt; stanza of type 'set' addressed to the account or server entity hosting
        the archive, with a 'query' payload. On receiving the query, the server pushes to the client a
        series of messages in chronological order from the archive that match the client's given criteria. After the
        results it then returns the &lt;iq/&gt; result to indicate that the query is completed.</p>
        <p class="" style="">The final &lt;iq/&gt; result response MUST include an RSM &lt;set/&gt; element, wrapped into a &lt;fin/&gt;
        element qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:mam:2' namespace, indicating the
      UID of the first and last message of the (possibly limited) result set. This
      allows clients to accurately page through messages.</p>

An item in a MUC archive matches if the publisher of the item matches the JID; note that this should only be available to entities that would already have been allowed to know the publisher of the events (e.g. this could not be used by a visitor to a semi-anonymous MUC).</p>
      <p class="" style="">To allow querying for messages the user sent to themselves, the client needs to set the 'with' attribute to the account JID. In that case, the server MUST only return results where both the 'to' and 'from' match the bare JID (either as bare or by ignoring the resource), as otherwise every message in the archive would match.</p>
      <p class="" style="">If 'with' is omitted, the server MUST match all messages in the selected timespan with the query,

    <p class="" style="">Note: There is no concept of an "open query", and servers MUST be prepared to receive arbitrary page requests at any time.</p>
    <p class="" style="">RSM does not define the behaviour of including both &lt;before&gt; and &lt;after&gt; in the same request. To retrieve a range of items between two known ids, use before-id and after-id in the query form instead.</p>
    <p class="" style="">If the UID contained within an &lt;after&gt; or &lt;before&gt; element is not present in the archive, the server MUST return an item-not-found error in response to the query.</p>

    <p class="" style="">When the results returned by the server are complete (that is: when they have not been limited by the maximum size of the result page (either as specified or enforced by the server)), the server MUST include a 'complete' attribute on the &lt;fin&gt; element, with a value of 'true'; this informs the client that it doesn't need to perform further paging to retreive the requested data. If it is not the last page of the result set, the server MUST either omit the 'complete' attribute, or give it a value of 'false'.</p>

    <p class="" style="">Sometimes (e.g. due to network or storage partitioning, or other transient errors) the server might return results to a client that are unstable (e.g. they might later change in sequence or content). In such a situation the server MUST stamp the &lt;fin&gt; element with a 'stable' attribute with a value of 'false'. If the server knows that the data it's serving are stable it MUST either stamp a 'stable' attribute with a value of 'true', or no such attribute. An example of when unstable might legitimately be returned is if the MAM service uses a clustered data store and a query covers a time period for which the data store has not yet converged; it the server could return best-guess results and tell the client that they may be unstable. A client SHOULD NOT cache unstable results long-term without later confirming (by reissuing appropriate queries) that they have become stable.</p>

      For example, if a client implements a user interface that automatically fetches older messages as a user scrolls backward,
      it may want to receive and display the newest messages first, instead of waiting for the whole page to be received.</p>
      <p class="" style="">A client wishing for a reversed page should include the &lt;flip-page/&gt; element in its query, like so:</p>

  <div class="indent"><h3 id="business-storeret">6.1 Storage and Retrieval Rules<a class="anchor-link" href="#business-storeret"><abbr title="Link to this point in the document">¶</abbr></a></h3>
  	<p class="" style="">Different entities will have different requirements for which data are stored, as might different deployments. This section provides general rules within which a server will act. While there may be local policy restrictions that prevent archiving of some aspects discussed here, this is a RECOMMENDED baseline. A server MAY implement any subset of possible archives for JIDs it controls (although it MUST advertise support only for those JIDs that support it).</p>
	<p class="" style="">No requirements are placed on how a server implements its storage beyond that it has to store data sufficient to be able to comply with this document. When this document describes storage requirements (e.g. MUST NOT store more than one copy...), it refers to what would appear to have been stored in order to satisfy the query.</p>
    <p class="" style="">If an entity (user's server, MUC room, pubsub node, ...) rejects an incoming message (such as from an occupant not allowed to send messages to the room, a user not authorized to publish to a pubsub node, a contact blocked by the user etc.) that message should not appear in the archive for the entity that rejected it - the archive should represent what logical entities (MUC occupants, users, pubsub subscribers...) would have received, and so only contain messages accepted for delivery to such entities.</p>
  	<div class="indent"><h4 id="business-storeret-user-archives">6.1.1 User Archives<a class="anchor-link" href="#business-storeret-user-archives"><abbr title="Link to this point in the document">¶</abbr></a></h4>
  		<p class="" style="">A user archive is anticipated to provide the user with the ability to access their prior conversations. To this end, a server SHOULD include in a user archive all of the messages a user sends or receives of type 'normal' or 'chat' that contain a &lt;body&gt; element.  A server MAY include additional non-conversation messages. A server MAY include messages of type 'headline', but this is not generally suggested.</p>
      <p class="" style="">Previous versions of this specification stated that a server SHOULD also include messages of type 'groupchat' that have a &lt;body&gt; - however many deployments did not follow this (although some did). This advice has now been dropped, and servers MAY include groupchat messages in their archives. Whether a server stores groupchat messages or not is now left as an implementation (or deployment) decision. Whether a client wants to receive groupchat messages in results can be signalled with the 'include-groupchat' field (if supported by the server - see <a href="#support">Determining support</a>) - where the server doesn't support this field, or where a client doesn't specify it in the query, whether groupchat messages are included in the result is implementation-defined; this allows existing deployments to not break with the introduction of the 'include-groupchat' query field in a later version of this specification, but it is RECOMMENDED that all client implementations of the current version of this specification always include the field where the server supports it, and RECOMMENDED that servers support it.</p>
  		<p class="" style="">At a minimum, the server MUST store the &lt;body&gt; elements of a stanza. It is suggested that other elements that are used in a given deployment to supplement conversations (e.g. XHTML-IM payloads) are also stored. Other elements MAY be stored.</p>
  		<p class="" style="">If a server supports mechanisms that multiply copies of a stanza (e.g. Carbons, or forking a stanza to a bare JID), it MUST store such a staza within a given archive only once, irrespective of multiple connected clients receiving copies.</p>
      <p class="" style="">A server MAY choose not to deliver offline messages to a client that has already queried their MAM archive and received the archived copies of those messages that would otherwise be delivered - while not required of an implementation, this is helpful to avoid duplicate messages for clients, so is suggested.</p>

  		<p class="" style="">A MUC archives allows a user to view the conversation within a room. All messages sent to the room that contain a &lt;body&gt; element SHOULD be stored, as should subject change stanzas, apart from those messages that the room rejects.</p>
  		<p class="" style="">A MUC archive MUST store each message only once (not, for example, every copy sent out to an occupant).</p>
                <p class="" style="">A MUC archive MUST NOT include 'private message' results (those sent directly between occupants, not shared in the room) in the results.</p>
                <p class="" style="">A MUC archive MUST check that the user requesting the archive has the right to enter it at the time of the query and only allow access if so. In a members-only chat room, only owners, admins or members can query a room archive. In the case of open MUC rooms, the MUC archives can generally be accessed by any users (including those who have never entered the room) who do not have an affiliation of 'outcast', but a MUC archive MAY further limit access based on other criteria as part of the deployment policy. A MUC archive MAY, if it stores historical data about previous configuration states, limit the results returned to only those that the querying user would have been authorised to see at the time (e.g. it MAY limit the results to not include results while a user was an outcast).</p>
  		<p class="" style="">When sending out the archives to a requesting client, the forwarded stanza MUST NOT have a 'to' attribute, and the 'from' MUST be the occupant JID of the sender of the archived message.</p>
                <p class="" style="">In the case of non-anonymous rooms or if the recipient of the MUC archive has the right to access the sender real JID at the time of the query, the archive message will use extended message information in an &lt;x/&gt; element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user' namespace and containing an &lt;item/&gt; child with a 'jid' attribute specifying the occupant's full JID, as defined for non-anonymous room presence in <span class="ref" style=""><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html">Multi-User Chat (XEP-0045)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idm373">11</a>].

  <div class="indent"><h3 id="security-privacy">8.1 Data privacy<a class="anchor-link" href="#security-privacy"><abbr title="Link to this point in the document">¶</abbr></a></h3>
    <p class="" style="">An archive generally consists of private conversations, and so
    a server MUST adequately protect an archive from unauthorized third-party
    access. For example authorized parties for a user's archive would likely include
    just the user, and a MUC archive for a private room might be restricted
    to room members. An implementation MAY choose to allow access to any archive
    by server administrators. If a client
	requests access to an archive it does not have permissions for the server MUST
	return an iq with type error, and the error condition SHOULD be 'forbidden'.</p>
    <p class="" style="">A server SHOULD provide a mechanism for a user to disable archiving of
    messages with all or specific contacts, such as via the configuration
    protocol described in <span class="ref" style=""><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0441.html">Message Archive Management Preferences (XEP-0441)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idm431">15</a>]. This allows the user to prevent the
    archiving of potentially sensitive messages in the first place.</p>
    <p class="" style="">A server MAY automatically prevent certain sensitive messages from being
    archived. How such messages are identified is beyond the scope of this
    specification, but technologies such as <span class="ref" style=""><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0258.html">Security Labels in XMPP (XEP-0258)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idm436">16</a>] may be used, for example.</p>

    <p class="" style="">A client MUST verify the source of MAM query results against an open query (i.e. checking the stanza 'from' matches the entity that was queried) and MUST either ignore or otherwise disregard (maybe with a warning to the user) unsolicited results - whether because the 'from' doesn't match an open query, or because there is no open query. This is to avoid the situation where a malicious entity sends MAM results while the client is querying a different entity and the client processes the malicious results as if they were part of the legitimate results. Additionally, if the client has multiple queries in flight at once, it MUST also check that the query ID for a result matches that of an open query for that entity.</p>

    <p class="" style="">This specification re-uses the &lt;x&gt; element from the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user' namespace to convey information about the sender of a message in a MUC room. However this element is not sanitized by MUC services, so the archiving entity MUST strip any existing &lt;x&gt; element in the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user' namespace from messages before archiving them (regardless of whether it adds in its own &lt;x&gt; element).</p>

       Implementation Considerations<a class="anchor-link" href="#impl"><abbr title="Link to this point in the document">¶</abbr></a></h2>
  <p class="" style="">
    Queries in the 'urn:xmpp:mam:2' namespace can be limited using the RSM
    'before' and 'after' parameters.
    Normally these are opaque identifiers that are not known until the results
    of the first query are returned at which point they can be used to fetch
    subsequent pages.
    However, MAM specifically defines them as being equal to the archive ID,
    meaning that an acceptable value can be known and used in the initial query.
    This makes them equivalent to 'before-id' and 'after-id' defined in the
    'urn:xmpp:mam:2#extended' namespace except for the following differences:
  </p>
  <ol start="" class="" style="">
    <li class="" style="">
      The behavior of using RSM's 'before' and 'after' together is undefined,
    </li>
    <li class="" style="">
      And using 'before' implies paging backwards through the result set while
      using 'before-id' does not.
