       <a name="intro" id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
  <p>Multi-User Chat (MUC) is a major application of XMPP that was developed in 2002 and standardized in <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html">Multi-User Chat (XEP-0045)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp624160">1</a>]. The Mediated Infromation eXchange (MIX) protocol defined here implements the same basic MUC patterns in a more flexible and extensible way in order to address requirements that have emerged since MUC was developed. MIX supports all of the core chatroom features that are familiar from MUC, such as discussion topics and invitations. Like MUC, it also defines a strong access control model, including the ability to kick and ban users, to name  administrators, and to require membership in order to participate in channels. MIX is intended as a medium term replacement for MUC.</p>
  <p>MUC exists and works, so why replace it? There are several reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A number of use cases for group communication have emerged since MUC was first published.</li>
    <li>Experience has shown that it is difficult to use MUC to build several kinds of communication applications (such as a multimedia conference focus) without undesirable adaptations.</li>
    <li>It is impractical to address a number of the requirements listed in the next section with MUC or with extensions to MUC. </li>
    <li>In the years after MUC was designed, both <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html">Publish-Subscribe (XEP-0060)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp613728">2</a>] and <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html">Message Archive Management (XEP-0313)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp616448">3</a>] have been developed and it is desirable to reuse these building blocks (e.g., MAM can be used for message history) rather than using the less robust methods defined in <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html">Multi-User Chat (XEP-0045)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp611120">4</a>].</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Because it is anticipated that there will significant co-existence between MUC and MIX, this specification is designed so that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>XMPP clients can implement MUC and this specification in a way that provides a coherent user experience.</li>
    <li>XMPP servers can implement this specification and also provide a MUC interface in order to support clients that only implement MUC.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If a server wishes to expose both MUC and MIX representations of chatrooms, it is recommended to do so by serving MUC and MIX on different domains, but a server MAY server them on the same domain. The MIX service SHOULD include a reference to the MUC mirror, so that clients understanding both protocols can choose to only show one copy of the service.</p>
<h2>2.
       <a name="reqs" id="reqs">Requirements</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A user's participation in a channel persists and is not modified by the user's client going online and offline.</li>
    <li>Multiple devices associated with the same account can share the same nick in the channel, with well-defined rules making each client individually addressable.</li>
    <li>Channels are not required to support or reflect presence for participants.</li>
    <li>A reconnecting client can quickly resync with respect to messages and presence.</li>
    <li>A user may (subject to configuration) receive messages from a channel as an invisible observer.</li>
    <li>Configuration can be observed externally to the channel (e.g., list of participants, access control rights, etc.).</li>
    <li>MIX services should provide mechanisms to prevent JIDs from being harvested.</li>
    <li>MIX and Message Archive Management (MAM) should work well together.</li>
    <li>A user can determine which channels they participate in.</li>
    <li>Provide extensibility regarding data formats that can be sent within a channel (files, structured data, indications about media sources in multimedia conferences, etc.) as well as flexibility regarding which data formats a user wants to receive.</li>
    <li>Enable federation of a channel across multiple servers, to provide a service equivalent to "federated MUC" <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0289.html">Federated MUC for Constrained Environments (XEP-0289)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1514736">5</a>].</li>
    <li>(Desirable) Make it easier to reduce duplicate traffic.</li>
 </ul>
<h2>3.
       <a name="reqs" id="reqs">Concepts</a></h2>
  <p>The following concepts underlie the design of MIX.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>MIX channels (roughly equivalent to MUC rooms) are hosted on one or more MIX domains, (examples: `mix.example.com`; 'conference.example.com'; 'talk.example.com'), which are discoverable through <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html">Service Discovery (XEP-0030)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1524464">6</a>]. Each channel on a MIX service may then be discovered and queried.</li>
    <li> In MIX each channel (e.g., `channel@mix.example.com`) is a pubsub service. This is based on the model from <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0163.html">Personal Eventing Protocol (XEP-0163)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1519968">7</a>] where every user JID (e.g., `user@example.com`) is its own pubsub service. </li>
    <li>A channel's pubsub service contains a number of nodes for different event types or data formats. As described below, this document defines several standard nodes; however, future specifications or proprietary services can define their own nodes for extensibility.</li>
    <li>Affiliations with the nodes are managed by the MIX service by channel level operations, so that the user does not have to separately manage affiliations with the individual PubSub nodes.
     </li>
    <li><span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html">Message Archive Management (XEP-0313)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1522080">8</a>] (MAM) is used for all history access, with each node being individually addressable for MAM queries. This simplifies implementation compared to MUC (which had a specialized and rather limited history retrieval mechanism).</li>
    <li>A client can achieve a 'quick resync' of a node by requesting just those changes it has not yet received, using standard MAM protocol. This solves the old MUC issue of either receiving duplicate messages when rejoining a room or potentially missing messages.</li>
    <li>Because MAM is used for history, only those nodes that have a 'current value' need to store any items in them - e.g., 'urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence' and 'urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:subject' would store their current values (with older values being queryable through MAM), while 'urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:messages' would store no items.</li>
    <li>A user's participation in a channel outlives their presence session. A user who is offline will not share presence within the channel, but will still be listed as an participant. This too is a significant departure from MUC.</li>
    <li>MIX decouples addressing of occupants from their nicknames, so that nickname changes do not affect addressing.</li>
    <li>Each participant is addressable by a single bare JID, which is a proxy JID (not the user's real JID) to make it straightforward to hide the user's real JID from other channel participants. Full JIDs comprised of this bare JID plus a resource are then constructed, allowing transparency when a user has multiple online resources participating in the MIX.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="indent"><h3>3.1 <a name="concepts-pubsub" id="concepts-pubsub">MIX and PubSub</a></h3>
    <p>MIX is based upon domains providing a MIX service, such as `mix.shakespeare.example`. Note that although PubSub communication is used, a domain used for MIX is a MIX domain and not a standard <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html">Publish-Subscribe (XEP-0060)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1532608">9</a>] domain. (Note that, like in MUC, there is no requirement on the naming of these domains; the label 'mix' and the fact that it is a subdomain of a 'shakespeare.example' service are each purely an example).</p>
    <p>Every MIX channel is an addressable PubSub service (with additional MIX semantics) that will be addressed by an XMPP client using a bare JID, for example coven@mix.shakespeare.example. While <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html">Publish-Subscribe (XEP-0060)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1535616">10</a>] is used as the basis for the MIX model, MIX uses standard presence and groupchat messages to provide an interface to the MIX service that does not expose PubSub for many of the more common functions.
</p>
  </div>
  <div class="indent"><h3>3.2 <a name="concepts-mam" id="concepts-mam">MIX and MAM</a></h3>
    <p>Message Archive Management is used for all storage of historical data (such as the history of messages sent within the channel). Each node can be archived separately (e.g., the presence node or the configuration node). MIX clients can retrieve information archived in MAM in order to quickly resync messages with regard to a channel, and can do so without necessarily providing presence information.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="indent"><h3>3.3 <a name="concepts-delivery" id="concepts-delivery">Delivering Messages to Users</a></h3>
     <p>
       The primary model is that a user will join a channel over an extended period, and that the user (not a specific client used by the user) joins the channel.  The primary subscription is with the clients bare JID.  The user will receive messages from the channel and/or access channel presence from time to time with one or more clients.
     </p>
    <p>
      Where a user has no clients active, the approach expected by MIX is that messages will be archived using MAM and that when clients come online they will use MAM to access messages that have not been delivered to the client.   Following the rules of <span class="ref"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6121">RFC 6121</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1543312">11</a>], arriving MIX messages (which will be of type=groupchat) will be discarded if all clients are offline.    Offline messages are not used with MIX.
    </p>
    <p>
      Online clients are handled use <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0376.html">Pubsub Account Management (XEP-0376)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1546736">12</a>].
      The model is that the server will know which of the user's clients are interested in MIX messages, possibly filtered by MIX channel, and will deliver messages appropriately to these clients.  MIX will simply send messages to the user's server addressed with the bare JID of the user.   The user's server will then deliver messages to the user's clients, in a manner that is transparent to the MIX server. The same approach is used for sending presence updates to the user, noting that presence information is distributed by a channel to the bare JID of subscribers and then the user's server will distribute to clients as appropriate.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="indent"><h3>3.4 <a name="concepts-presence" id="concepts-presence">User Presence in MIX</a></h3>
    <p>
      MIX channels store presence in the presence node using the proxy JID of each online client for a user.   User presence may be included for all or selected clients of a given user, based on client choice to publish presence.    Where a user publishes presence for multiple clients, this information is available to all users subscribing to the channel presence. Queries such as disco requests will be directed to a specific client, routing through the MIX channel, while private messaging will be addressed to the user's bare proxy JID, and routed by the MIX to the user's bare real JID, where standard distribution rules will apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presence updates are distributed by a channel to the bare JID of subscribers and then the subscriber's server will distribute to each of the subscriber's currently online clients.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="indent"><h3>3.5 <a name="proxy-jid" id="proxy-jid">Proxy JIDs and JID Visibility</a></h3>
    <p>
      MIX channels have two modes controlling JID visibility:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>'JID Visible': In these channels, some or all participant JIDs are visible to all channel members.</li>
      <li>'JID Hidden': In these channels, no participant JIDs are visible to channel members, but they are visible to channel administrators.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A channel member may specify their preferences for JID visibility, with one of the following values:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>'No JID Visibility Preference': The users JID will be visible in JID Visible channels and hidden in JID Hidden channels.</li>
      <li>'Prefer Hidden': The user's JID will be hidden in JID Visible channels if the channel policy allows this.</li>
      <li>'Enforce Hidden': The user's JID will never be shown and the user will be removed from channel if channel administrator enforces visibility.</li>
      <li>'Enforce Visible': The users JID will always be shown and the user will be removed from channel if mode is changed to 'JID Hidden'.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The primary representation of a participant in a MIX channel is a proxy JID, which is an anonymized JID using the same domain as the channel and with the name of the channel encoded, using the format "&lt;channel&gt;+&lt;generated identifier&gt;@&lt;mix domain&gt;".   For example in the channel 'coven@mix.shakespeare.example',   the user 'hag66@shakespeare.example' might have a proxy JID of 'coven+123456@mix.shakespeare.example'.   The reason for the proxy JID is to support JID Hidden channels.   Proxy JIDs are also used in JID Visible channels, for consistency and to enable switching of JID visibility.  The "urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:jidmap" node maps from proxy JID to real JID.
    </p>
     <p>
       The full JIDs held in presence are anonymized using a similar mechanism.  First the bare JID is mapped to a bare proxy JID, using the mapping held in the "urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:jidmap" node for the bare JID.  Then the resource is replaced with a generated value.   For example,   'hag66@shakespeare.example' in the channel coven might have a proxy JID of 'coven+123456@mix.shakespeare.example/789'.   There is no client visible mapping of proxy full JIDs maintained as this is not needed.   The MIX channel will need to maintain a mapping, to support directly addressing clients, such as for client to client disco#info queries.
     </p>
  </div>
  <div class="indent"><h3>3.6 <a name="concepts-nodes" id="concepts-nodes">Standard Nodes</a></h3>
    <p>The standard nodes are as follows (although note that not every channel will necessarily use each node):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>'urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:messages' for publishing messages. Each item of this node will contain a message sent to the channel.</li>
      <li>'urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:subject' for publishing the subject of the channel.</li>
      <li>'urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:participants' for publishing the list of participants (identified by anonymized bare proxy JID), and identifying the nick.  This is a list of users who would receive messages (by subscription to the messages node) and/or would receive presence (by subscription to the presence node).</li>

      <li>'urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:jidmap' for publishing a list of anonymized bare JIDs from the participants node with a 1:1 mapping to the corresponding real JIDs.</li>


      <li>'urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence' for publishing information about the availability status of online participants, which may include multiple clients for a single participant. </li>


      <li>'urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:config' for storing configuration information. </li>

      <li>'urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:acl' for storing information about access control lists (such as the list of owners and administrators). This information will generally be restricted to authorized users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      jidmap is the only node that will always be present for a MIX channel and all other nodes are optional.   All channels will have either a message node, a presence node or both, because a channel will always share messages and/or presence.   MIX provides mechanisms to allow users to conveniently subscribe to a chosen set of nodes and to unsubscribe to all nodes with a single operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The structure of each of the standard nodes is now considered in more detail
    </p>
    <div class="indent"><h3>3.6.1 <a name="messages-node" id="messages-node">Messages Node</a></h3>
      <p>Items in this node will contain a message identified by a unique ID.  A MIX implementation SHOULD NOT make messages available for retrieval from this node using pubsub.  The recommended approach is that zero history is held in the messages node, and that this node is used for publication only.   The recommended approach to retrieve message history is MAM. Users subscribe to this node to receive messages.</p>
      <p>Private Messages are not stored in the messages node.</p>

      <p>The subject node publishes the current subject of channel.  Subject history is stored in MAM.    The id of each node is the current value of the channel subject.   A single item is stored in this node at a time.  Users subscribe to this node to receive subject updates. The following example shows the format of a item in the Subject node.</p>

      <p>Each channel participant is represented as an item of the 'urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:participants' channel node.   Each item is named by the bare JID of the participant.   For example 'coven+123456@mix.shakespeare.example' might name the node item associated with participant 'hag66@shakespeare.example'.  The nick associated with the user is mandatory and is stored in the item.
      This node may be subscribed to for jid-visible channels that permit subscription to this node - this will allow users to see changes to channel membership.

      <p>
        The presence node contains the presence value for clients belonging to participants that choose to publish presence to the channel.   A MIX channel may require that all participants publish presence.  Each item in the presence node is identified by the full anonymized proxy JID, and contains the current presence value for that JID.  The presence is encoded in the same way as data that would be sent in a presence message.  The full anonymized JID is always used in this node.   In MIX it is possible to have a 'presence-less channel' by not using this node. Access Control may be set to enforce that for each of the full JIDs in this list, the bare JID MUST be in the participants list.
      </p>
      <p>QUESTION:  The current specification allows channels to be configured so that node subscription is not restricted to participants (although this restriction is the default).  Is this flexibility desirable, or should we restrict to participants?</p>
      <p>
        This node may be subscribed to by users using bare JID.  So presence of online clients is sent to all users subscribed to this node, noting that presence is always sent using standard presence protocol.

      <p>The ACL node is closely related to the configuration node, and contains more information that will generally be more restricted as to who can access and modify.   An anticipated configuration reflected in the defaults has ACL node configured so that it can be modified by channel owners and read only by channel owners and administrators.

      <p>A user joins a channel by sending a MIX "join" command. There is no default set of nodes, so user MUST specify the set of nodes to be subscribed to. To achieve the equivalent service to MUC, a user would subscribe to messages, presence and subject.
         This will lead to the server subscribing the user to each of the requested nodes associated with the channel. The MIX server will also add the user to the participant list by injecting a new item into the "urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:participants" node automatically.

      </p>
      <p>The default MIX model is that only channel participants may subscribe to nodes.    A MIX channel MAY allow non-participant subscription.   This will be handled by clients directly subscribing to the desired PubSub nodes.</p>

If a user cannot be subscribed to one or more of the requested nodes (e.g., because the node does not exist), but can be subscribed to some the response simply lists the nodes successfully subscribed.    If none of the nodes requested are successfully subscribed to, and error response is sent indicating the reason that the first node requested was not subscribed to.   This response will also include other nodes requested where subscription failed for the same reason.  A user may subsequently request subscription to nodes in a channel to which the user was not initially subscribed.  </p>

        Following the MIX server side processing, the user's server will usually add the MIX channel to the user's roster using one way presence.   This means that the MIX channel will get presence information from the user.  This roster entry will lead to correct handling of the user's presence in the MIX channel.   If the user does not wish to publish presence and the channel permits this, then this roster addition does not happen.  If the channel requires presence and the user removes the channel from the user's roster, the channel MAY remove the user as a channel participant.

    <p>
      Each member of a channel may have a nick, which is how other users in the channel will see the user.  In some cases a nick is not needed, for example where a user reads messages in a channel but does not send messages or share presence information.    A nick MUST be present for a user to send a message to a channel or for a user's presence to be shared on a channel.   There are four ways that a user's nick can be obtained.   The choice of mechanism or mechanisms is dependent on channel policy:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The nick is registered with the user account in some way, for example as part of user provisioning with nick configured as an attribute in a directory service.   This may be chosen by corporate services that wish to ensure consistent nick values for a set of users and channels.</li>
      <li>The nick is registered with the MIX service, as described in  <a href="#usecase-user-register"> Registering a Nick </a>.</li>
      <li>The user explicitly sets the nick, as described in this section.</li>
      <li>The MIX service generates the nick.  In this case it is recommended that the assigned nick is a UUID unique identifier following <span class="ref"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122">RFC 4122</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1679648">22</a>].  </li>
    </ol>
    <p>AUTHOR'S NOTE AND QUESTION:  REVIEW use of UUID.  Can it make sense for other algorithms, such as a string from the JID</p>
    <p>
   A user will typically set a nick when joining a channel and may update this nick from time to time.   The user does this by sending a command to the channel to set the nick.  If the user wishes the channel to assign a nick (or knows that the channel will assign a nick) the nick field can be left blank, so that the user can see what is assigned in the result.

    <div class="indent"><h3>5.1.6 <a name="usecase-user-presence" id="usecase-user-presence">Setting User Presence</a></h3>
      <p>

        A user joins a channel over an extended period, and membership in a channel does not generally change when user goes online or offline.   The users  membership of the channel is reflected by the user's bare JID in the participant node.   All messages to the channel are sent to this JID.

      </p>
      <p>

        A user may share presence information with the channel, for one or more online clients.   Where a user shares presence information with a channel, the channel is entered by the user's server into the user's roster when the user subscribes to the channel.  When an XMPP client comes online or changes presence status, this will be communicated by the user to the user's server using broadcast presence.  The user's XMPP server is then responsible to share this presence information to each entry in the roster and in particular to each MIX channel in the roster.  The MIX channel will update the "urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence" node with any change of status and the updated presence information and then share this updated presence with users subscribed to this node, as described below.   When the user sets an explicit status, this is used to modify the presence node in the channel.   When a client being used by the user goes offline, the associated server will send presence status "unavailable" to the MIX channel, which will cause the full JID for that client to be removed from the presence node.
      </p>
      <p>
        A channel may require that all channel members share presence information with the channel, which is represented in the "urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence" node.   If sharing presences is required by the channel, an XMPP client conforming to this specification SHALL share presence with the channel by including the channel in the user's roster. Note that the MIX server cannot generally enforce this, but it can require and enforce that when a message is sent to the channel, that the sender of the message is in the presence list.
      </p>
      <p>
      Presence status and availability is set in a MIX channel by standard presence messages sent to the MIX channel by the user's server.   User's wishing to receive presence updates will subscribe to the MIX channel presence node.   Presence updates are sent out to subscribing using standard XEP-0045 compatible presence messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user setting status is now used as an example.   Unlike in <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html">Multi-User Chat (XEP-0045)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1701376">24</a>] where coming online is a special action, coming online in MIX is implicit when presence status is set.  Going offline is a achieved by setting presence status to unavailable, which removes the client full JID entry from the presence node.  When a user sets a presence status, the user's server sends updated presence to the MIX channel, and the MIX server then publishes the user's  availability to the "urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence" node. If there is not an item named by the full JID of the client with updated presence status, this item is created.   If there is not an item named by the full JID of the client with updated presence status, then an item is created.</p>

     The presence is distributed to those subscribing to the MIX channel presence node using a standard XMPP presence message.   The presence change is recorded on the "urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence" node in the item for the full JID of the client to which the presence relates. The history of this node will be held as PubSub format in the MAM archive, so that presence history may be viewed.

      <p>
        The presence information for a channel  is stored in the urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence node and distributed using standard presence messages to users subscribing to this presence node.  The user's server will then pass this presence information on to all online clients.   When a client goes offline, it will lose synchronization with the presence node.    When the client comes online, the clients server will send a directed presence message to the MIX channel.   This will happen as a consequence of the MIX channel being in the user's roster and the MIX channel sending a presence update to the MIX channel.  When the MIX channel adds or modifies presence for a client to the roster, this presence change will be distributed to all users subscribing to the presence node.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the full JID of a client is added to the MIX channel presence node and that full JID is not in the presence list, the MIX channel will send to the client presence for all of the items in the presence node using standard presence messages.  This will give the client full current presence.

      <p>
        Presence information will provide a MIX client with the nicks and anonymized proxy JIDs for participants.   For JID visible rooms, the user may look up the real JID using the "urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:jidmap" node.   The items in this node are identified by proxy JID, and so the real JID can be retrieved using a straightforward PubSub query.    While a user may subscribe to the jidmap node, it is more likely to be used to directly look up JIDs as and when needed.

    <div class="indent"><h3>5.1.9 <a name="usecase-sync-history" id="usecase-sync-history">Coming Online: Synchronizing Message History</a></h3>
      <p>
        A MIX client will typically display message history of the channel to the user.   When a client comes online it will need to obtain this message history from the MAM archive associated with the channel.  There are three basic approaches a client will take:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>If the client has previously displayed message history and has been offline for a reasonably small time, the client will wish to retrieve all messages since the last one displayed to the user.</li>
        <li>The client may wish to display a fixed number of messages, perhaps finding more messages if the client subsequently requests.</li>
        <li>The client may wish to display messages from a recent time period, perhaps finding more messages if the client subsequently requests.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>AUTHOR'S NOTE:  Examples to be added</p>
    </div>


    <div class="indent"><h3>5.1.10 <a name="usecase-user-offline" id="usecase-user-offline">Going Offline</a></h3>
      <p>When a client goes offline, this presence update is sent by the client's server to the MIX channel.   From the client perspective, this is the same as any other presence change.   Handling by the MIX channel is slightly different.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="example-27" id="example-27"></a>Example 27. Client Goes Offline in the Channel</p><div class="indent"><pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;presence type='unavailable'
    from='hag66@shakespeare.example/pda'
    to='coven@mix.shakespeare.example'/&gt;
      </pre></div>
      <p>The MIX channel will retract (remove) the item in the presence node of the MIX channel identified by the client's full JID.  The MIX channel will notify subscribers to the presence node of the user going offline using a presence message from the proxy JID of the client.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="example-28" id="example-28"></a>Example 28. Channel Distributes Notification of Client going Offline</p><div class="indent"><pre class="prettyprint">

          type=unavailable
        &lt;/presence&gt;

      </pre></div>

      <p>
        There is the possibility that the message associated with the user going offline will be lost.   If this happens, "ghost" entries will appear in the presence node.   A MIX server may take steps to address this, for example by probing client with a disco for presence items that remain unchanged for a long period.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is desirable to prevent clients from going offline briefly and then coming back online again, as this will lead to "flapping presence".   The recommended approach to achieve this is use of <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html">Stream Management (XEP-0198)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1722736">25</a>] to maintain an XMPP client connection in the event of short term TCP failure.

      <p>
        A MIX channel MAY support message retraction, where the sender of a messages deletes a messages from the message history and optionally replace it with another message.   This retraction mechanism will be based on the <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html">Publish-Subscribe (XEP-0060)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1731296">27</a>] retract operation.   A client looking at message history may choose to look at "current state" which will show status after the retraction or "full history" which will include the message that was retracted.
      </p>
      <p>
        AUTHOR'S NOTE: Define new protocol to support this and add example.

      <p>When a channel member invites another user to join a channel, a sequence of steps are followed.

      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The channel member sends to the channel requesting an invite for the user.</li>
        <li>The channel sends an invitation to the user requesting the invite.</li>
        <li>The channel member sends the invitation to the invitee.</li>
        <li>The invitee uses the invitation to construct a request to join the channel.</li>
      </ol>
      <p> AUTHOR'S NOTES AND QUESTION:   To be expanded considerably.   Dave (Cridland?) raised a point about contact preverification about users' invites.  If this is still relevant, please raise it again and we will consider how to address it. </p>

      <p>
        A user may add a proxy JID from the participants node of a MIX channel to the user's roster.  This will enable convenient communication with the user through the MIX channel, without the user knowing the real JID of the channel participant.

  <div class="indent"><h3>5.2 <a name="use-mam" id="use-mam">Use of MAM</a></h3>
    <p>
      All nodes of each MIX channel are archived using MAM.   Access to history in these nodes uses standard MAM protocol to access the channel nodes and to retrieve information from the nodes.   Information retrieved using MAM will be of the format stored on the node and will include <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html">Publish-Subscribe (XEP-0060)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1743904">28</a>] PubSub wrapping.  MAM is the MIX mechanism to get at this information, in preference to direct use of PubSub.
    </p>
    <p>
      AUTHOR'S NOTE:  Add example of message retrieved using MAM, showing XEP-0060 wrapping
    </p>
    <p>
      There are XEPs that extend MAM and in some cases modify core MAM requirements.   Such XEPs may be used in conjunction with MAM, provided that they are supported by the MIX channel.   If such XEPs are used, the requirements specified MUST be followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      PubSub provides the ability to modify the state of the node, and distinguishes between current state and full history.   It is anticipated that MAM will be extended with an option to choose between "current state" and "full history".   This capability will be useful for and used by MIX.
    </p>
    <p>
      AUTHOR'S NOTE: This specification will be updated to reference this MAM extension when it is written.

      <p>
        MIX channels are always explicitly destroyed by an owner of the channel or by a server operator.   There is no concept of temporary channel, equivalent to <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html">Multi-User Chat (XEP-0045)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1760672">29</a>] temporary room which is automatically destroyed by the server when the users leave.   However, channels may be configured with an explicit lifetime, after which the channel MUST be removed by the MIX server.   Where a channel is created for ad hoc use, it may be desirable to keep the channel for history reference or for re-use by the same set of users.


      </p>

      <p>Note that the owner of the channel does not need to have presence registered in the channel in order to destroy it.</p>
