  <div class="indent"><h3>1.1 <a name="intro-why" id="intro-why">Why Dialback?</a></h3>
    <p class="" style="">When Jabber technologies were first developed in 1998, they were conceived of as a client-server system similar to email, wherein a client would connect to a server in order to communicate with other clients. Similarly, servers would connect with peer servers to provide inter-domain communication (often called "federation"). In a system that allows federation, it is important for a server to be able to determine the identity of a peer server; accepting a connection from any peer without determining its identity would result in the use of merely asserted identities and a completely uncontrolled approach to federation, which on the open Internet would rapidly devolve into chaos. Clearly such a state of affairs would be unsustainable for a network protocol aiming for widespread deployment.</p>
    <p class="" style="">Unfortunately, that was the state of affairs on the Jabber network during the earliest releases of the original <span class="ref" style=""><a href="http://jabberd.org/">jabberd</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-id2251574">1</a>] server codebase (up through the 1.0 release in May 2000). Therefore the open-source developer community designed a protocol ("Server Dialback") for weak identity verification based on the Domain Name System (DNS), built support for that protocol into the jabberd 1.2 server (released in October 2000), and mandated support for that protocol on the emerging Jabber server network.</p>
    <p class="" style="">When the core Jabber protocols were formalized by the XMPP Working Group of the <span class="ref" style=""><a href="http://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-id2251794">2</a>] in 2002-2004, support for strong identity verification was added. That support takes the form of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for encryption of server-to-server XML streams and the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) for authentication of such streams, using digital certificates issued by trusted root certificate authorities (CAs). Documentation of TLS and SASL within XMPP is provided in <span class="ref" style=""><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3920">XMPP Core</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-id2251592">3</a>]. However, the Server Dialback protocol is still in wide use, and probably will be for the foreseeable future given the difficulty (real or perceived) of obtaining digital certificates issued by common CAs. (The <span class="ref" style=""><a href="http://xmpp.org/xsf/">XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-id2251618">4</a>] has worked to make certificates easier to obtain by running the <span class="ref" style=""><a href="http://xmpp.org/ca/">XMPP Intermediate Certification Authority</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-id2251650">5</a>].)</p>
    <p class="" style="">Therefore it is important to maintain accurate documentation of the Server Dialback protocol. Such documentation was originally provided in <span class="ref" style=""><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3920">RFC 3920</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-id2251684">6</a>]. Although that documentation was removed from <span class="ref" style=""><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-saintandre-rfc3920bis">rfc3920bis</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-id2251711">7</a>], it is still provided in this specification for the sake of interoperability.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="indent"><h3>1.2 <a name="intro-models" id="intro-models">Federation Models</a></h3>
    <p class="" style="">There are at least four levels of server-to-server federation in Jabber/XMPP networks:</p>
    <ol start="1" class="" style="">
      <li class="" style=""><p class="" style="">Permissive Federation -- a server accepts a connection from any other peer on the network, even without verifiying the identity of the peer based on DNS lookups. The lack of peer verification or authentication means that domains can be spoofed.</p></li>
      <li class="" style=""><p class="" style="">Verified Federation -- a server accepts a connection from a peer only after the identity of the peer has been weakly verified based on information obtained via the Domain Name System (DNS). However, the connection is not encrypted or authenticated. The use of identity verification effectively prevents domain spoofing, but federation requires proper DNS setup and is still subject to DNS poisoning attacks.</p></li>
      <li class="" style=""><p class="" style="">Encrypted Federation -- a server accepts a connection from a peer only if the peer supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) as defined for XMPP in <span class="ref">RFC 3920</span> and the peer presents a digital certificate. However, the certificate can be self-signed, in which case mutual authentication is typically not possible. Therefore, after STARTTLS negotiation the parties proceed to weakly verify identity based on DNS information as under Verified Federation. This combination results in an encrypted connection with weak identity verification.</p></li>
      <li class="" style=""><p class="" style="">Trusted Federation -- a server accepts a connection from a peer only if the peer supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) and the peer presents a digital certificate issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA). The list of trusted root CAs is determined by local service policy, as is the level of trust accorded to various types of certificates (e.g., Class 1, Class 2, or Class 3). The use of trusted domain certificates effectively prevents DNS poisoning attacks and results in mutual authentication.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="" style="">This specification documents the technology that enabled the Jabber server network to advance beyond Permissive Federation to Verified Federation. Combined with the use of TLS, Server Dialback can also result in Encrypted Federation. However, Trusted Federation is not possible with Server Dialback.</p>
    <p class="" style="">Note: For detailed examples showing the protocol flows and outcomes of dialback negotiation for a wide variety of federation scenarios, refer to <span class="ref" style=""><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0238.html">XMPP Protocol Flows for Inter-Domain Federation</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-id2262556">8</a>].</p>
  </div>

  <div class="indent"><h3>1.3 <a name="intro-what" id="intro-what">What Dialback Accomplishes</a></h3>
    <p class="" style="">Server Dialback is a method for weak identify verification. Such verification depends on the Domain Name System (DNS) and the use of keys based on a shared secret known to all XMPP servers within a given trust domain (e.g., the trust domain associated with a given second-level DNS domain such as "example.com" and all of its subdomains).</p>
    <p class="" style="">Since October 2000, the use of Server Dialback has made it more difficult to spoof the hostnames of servers (and therefore the addresses of sent messages) on the XMPP network. However, Server Dialback does not provide authentication between servers and is not a security mechanism. Domains requiring high security are advised to use TLS and SASL with certificates issued by trusted roots.</p>
    <p class="" style="">Server Dialback is uni-directional, and results in weak identity verification for one XML stream in one direction. Because Server Dialback is not an authentication mechanism, mutual authentication is not possible via dialback. Therefore, Server Dialback must be completed in each direction in order to enable bi-directional communication between two domains.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="indent"><h3>1.4 <a name="intro-when" id="intro-when">When Dialback Is Used</a></h3>
    <p class="" style="">Server Dialback is typically used in two scenarios:</p>
    <ol start="1" class="" style="">
      <li class="" style=""><p class="" style="">When a peer service does not support XMPP 1.0 as defined in <span class="ref">RFC 3920</span> or, more generally, does not offer negotiation of TLS.</p></li>
      <li class="" style=""><p class="" style="">When STARTTLS negotiation succeeds with a peer service but the peer's certificate is not strong enough to result in mutual authentication via SASL (e.g., because the certificate presented by the peer service during TLS negotiation is self-signed and local service policies stipulate that it is preferable to weakly identify the peer service via Server Dialback rather than depend on the self-signed certificate for identity verification).</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="" style="">Both of these scenarios result in an untrusted connection (verified federation in the first scenario and encrypted federation in the second scenario). However, depending on local security policies, a server might accept such an untrusted connection if the use of Server Dialback results in weak identity verification.</p>
    <p class="" style="">Dialback is not used if SASL is used for server-to-server authentication, since SASL provides strong authentication using certificates, pre-established passwords, or other credentials.</p>
    <p class="" style="">A service cannot begin negotiation of Server Dialback unless its peer advertises support for the Server Dialback protocol. As described under <a href="#o2r-processinitial">Receiving Server Processes Initial Stream Header</a>, a peer advertises support through inclusion of the Server Dialback namespace declaration in its response stream header and (for XMPP 1.0 servers) through inclusion of the Server Dialback stream feature.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="indent"><h3>1.5 <a name="intro-howitworks" id="intro-howitworks">How Dialback Works</a></h3>
    <p class="" style="">The basic idea behind Server Dialback is that a receiving server does not accept XMPP traffic from a sending server until it has "called back" the authoritative server for the domain asserted by the sending server, and verified that the sending server is truly authorized to generate XMPP traffic for that domain.</p>
    <p class="" style="">A helpful analogy might be the following telephone scenario:</p>
    <ol start="1" class="" style="">
      <li class="" style="">A representative from your electric utility company knocks on your front door and says he needs to enter your house.</li>
      <li class="" style="">Rather than letting him in, you ask for his employee ID number and politely close the door for a few moments.</li>
      <li class="" style="">You open the phone book, find the authoritative phone number for the utility company's headquarters, and call them on the phone.</li>
      <li class="" style="">After being transferred to the customer service department, you ask if a rep with that particular ID number is authorized to be visiting your house.</li>
      <li class="" style="">The company tells you that the rep is authorized, so you thank them and hang up.</li>
      <li class="" style="">You then reopen the front door and allow the rep to enter your house.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="" style="">In Server Dialback, the equivalent of the utility company representative is the ORIGINATING SERVER, i.e., the machine that wants to send a message to an entity at a destination domain and thus is attempting to establish a connection between the two servers. The equivalent of the person at the house is the RECEIVING SERVER, i.e., the machine to which the originating server has opened a connection for the purpose of sending the message and thus is trying to authenticate that the Originating Server represents the domain which it claims to be. And the equivalent of the company headquarters is the AUTHORITATIVE SERVER, i.e., the machine that answers to a DNS lookup for the domain asserted by the originating server (which is not necessarily the machine associated with the originating server); for basic environments this will be the Originating Server, but it could be a separate machine in the Originating Server's network (where "network" is defined by knowledge of a shared secret for verification of dialback keys).</p>
    <p class="" style="">The basic flow of events in Server Dialback is as follows:</p>
    <ol start="1" class="" style="">
      <li class="" style="">The Originating Server performs a DNS lookup on the hostname of the Receiving Server, opens a TCP connection to the discovered IP address and port, and establishes an XML stream with the Receiving Server.</li>
      <li class="" style="">The Originating Server generates a dialback key and sends that value over its XML stream with the Receiving Server.</li>
      <li class="" style="">The Receiving Server does not immediately accept the connection but instead performs a DNS lookup on the hostname of the Authoritative Server, opens a TCP connection to the discovered IP address and port, and establishes an XML stream with the Authoritative Server.</li>
      <li class="" style="">The Receiving Server sends the same dialback key over its XML stream with the Authoritative Server for verification.</li>
      <li class="" style="">The Authoritative Server replies that the key is valid or invalid.</li>
      <li class="" style="">The Receiving Server informs the Originating Server whether its identify has been verified or not.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="" style="">We can represent this flow of events graphically as follows.</p>

  <p class="" style="">This section describes the detailed protocol interaction between the Originating Server, the Receiving Server, and the Authoritative Server.</p>
  <p class="" style="">The examples in this section use the following domain names, IP addresses, stream IDs, and shared secret:</p>
  <ul class="" style="">
    <li class="" style="">The Originating Server is "example.org" (there is no IP address associated with this domain since it is merely asserted by the Originating Server).</li>
    <li class="" style="">The Receiving Server is "xmpp.example.com" and the discovered IP address for the XMPP service at that domain is "192.0.2.1" or "192.0.2.2" (see below).</li>
    <li class="" style="">The Authoritative Server is "example.org" and the discovered IP address for the XMPP service at that domain is "192.0.2.23".</li>
    <li class="" style="">The stream ID of the stream from the Originating Server to the Receiving Server is "D60000229F".</li>
    <li class="" style="">The shared secret known by the Authoritative Server's network is "s3cr3tf0rd14lb4ck".</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="" style="">To assist the reader, the following conventions are used to clarify the flow of packets:</p>
  <ul class="" style="">
    <li class="" style="">"O2R:" -- packets sent from the Originating Server to the Receiving Server.</li>
    <li class="" style="">"R2O:" -- packets sent from the Receiving Server to the Originating Server.</li>

    <li class="" style="">"A2R:" -- packets sent from the Authoritative Server to the Receiving Server.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="" style="">Note: Any error that occurs during dialback negotiation MUST be considered a stream error, resulting in termination of the stream and potentially of the underlying TCP connection. The possible error conditions are specified in the protocol description below.</p>

      <p class="" style="">Before opening a TCP connection to the Receiving Server, the Originating Server first needs to determine the appropriate IP address and port at which to connect. This is done by resolving the Receiving Server's hostname ("xmpp.example.com") using the Domain Name System. As described in <span class="ref">XMPP Core</span>, the Originating Server will first attempt to resolve a TCP service of _xmpp-server for that hostname using DNS SRV records.

      <p class="" style="">These records show that server-to-server connections for the XMPP service "xmpp.example.com" are serviced by two machines: x1.example.com at port 5269 and x2.example.com at port 9625.</p>
      <p class="" style="">Based on the SRV record weights, the Originating Server would then attempt to resolve one of these machines further. Here the Originating Server resolves x2.example.com, for which a standard A lookup yields an IP address of "192.0.2.2".</p>
      <p class="" style="">Note: As described in <span class="ref">XMPP Core</span>, if the Receiving Server does not provide appropriate DNS SRV records then in order to resolve the hostname of the Receiving Server the Originating Server can fall back to normal IPv4/IPv6 address record resolution to determine the IP address and assume a port of 5269 as registered with the IANA.</p>

      <p class="" style="">Before opening a TCP connection to the Authoritative Server, the Receiving Server first needs to determine the appropriate IP address and port at which to connect. This is done by resolving the Authoritative Server's hostname ("example.org") using the Domain Name System. As described in <span class="ref">XMPP Core</span>, the Receiving Server will first attempt to resolve a TCP service of _xmpp-server for that hostname using DNS SRV records. Here we assume that example.org has the following records in its DNS configuration:</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="example-19" id="example-19"></a>Example 19. DNS SRV Record for Authoritative Server</p><div class="indent"><pre>
_xmpp-server._tcp.example.org. 86400 IN SRV 10 0 5269 foo.example.org
      </pre></div>
      <p class="" style="">These records show that server-to-server connections for the XMPP service "example.org" are serviced by the physical machine foo.example.org at port 5269.</p>
      <p class="" style="">The Receiving Server would then resolve that machine to an IP address, in this case "192.0.2.23".</p>
      <p class="" style="">Note: As described in <span class="ref">XMPP Core</span>, if the Authoritative Server does not provide appropriate DNS SRV records then in order to resolve the hostname of the Authoritative Server the Receiving Server can fall back to normal IPv4/IPv6 address record resolution to determine the IP address and assume a port of 5269 as registered with the IANA.</p>

    <div class="indent"><h3>2.3.2 <a name="r2a-connect" id="r2a-connect">Receiving Server Opens TCP Connection</a></h3>
      <p class="" style="">Once the Receiving Server has resolved "example.org" to an IP address of 192.0.2.23 and port of 5269, it opens a TCP connection to that IP and port.</p>
      <p class="" style="">Note: Instead of opening a new TCP connection to the Authoritative Server, the Receiving Server MAY reuse an existing TCP connnection; for details, see the <a href="#piggybacking">Reuse of Negotiated Connections ("Piggybacking")</a> section of this document.</p>

      <div class="indent"><h3>2.5.3.2 <a name="validate-process-error" id="validate-process-error">Error Cases</a></h3>
        <p class="" style="">There are several reasons why the Receiving Server's processing of the validation result might fail:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="" style="">
          <li class="" style="">The value of the 'id' attribute does not match that provided by the Receiving Server in the verification request.</li>

          <li class="" style="">The value of the 'to' address does not match a hostname serviced by the Receiving Server.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="" style="">These error cases are described more fully in the remainder of this section.</p>
        <p class="" style="">If the value of the 'id' attribute does not match that provided by the Receiving Server in the verification request, then the Receiving Server MUST generate an &lt;invalid-id/&gt; stream error condition and terminate both the XML stream and the underlying TCP connection between it and the Authoritative Server.</p>

      <p class="" style="">Once the Receiving Server successfully processes the validation result it received from the Authoritative Server, it informs the Originating Server of the result. This is done by creating a &lt;db:result/&gt; element whose XML character data is the dialback key; the element MUST possess a 'from' attribute whose value is the hostname of the Receiving Server, MUST possess a 'to' attribute whose value is the hostname of the Originating Server, MUST possess an 'id' attribute whose value is the stream identifier from the Receiving Server's response stream header to the Originating Server, and MUST possess a 'type' attribute whose value is either "valid" or "invalid".</p>

        <p class="" style="">If the Authoritative Server reported the dialback key as valid, the Receiving Server has verified the identity of the Originating Server. As a result, the Receiving Server can now accept XML stanzas from the Originating Server over the validated connection (i.e., over the "initial stream" from the Originating Server to the Receiving Server). However, in accordance with <span class="ref">XMPP Core</span>, the Receiving Server MUST follow the rules specified therein regarding inclusion and checking of 'from' and 'to' attributes on all XML stanzas it receives from the Originating Server. These checks help to prevent address spoofing.</p>
        <p class="box" style="">Note Well: If the Receiving Server receives any XML stanzas from the Originating Server before the initial stream has been validated, the Receiving Server MUST silently drop those stanzas.</p>
        <p class="" style="">As mentioned, Server Dialback results in weak identity verification in one direction only (in the foregoing text, verification of the Originating Server by the Receiving Server). In order to proceed with bi-directional communication so that the Receiving Server can send XML stanzas to the Originating Server, the Receiving Server MUST now also initiate a dialback negotiation with the Originating Server (i.e., assume the role of an originating server in a new dialback negotiation).</p>

<h2>3.
       <a name="piggybacking" id="piggybacking">Reuse of Negotiated Connections ("Piggybacking")</a></h2>
  <p class="" style="">After the Receiving Server has validated a connection from the Originating Server, the Originating Server might wish to reuse that connection for validation of additional domains. This feature is called PIGGYBACKING. Support for piggybacking is OPTIONAL.</p>
  <p class="" style="">One common motivation for such reuse is the existence of additional services associated with the Originating Server but hosted at subdomains of the Originating Server (the use of subdomains helps to ensure proper routing of XML stanzas to the hosted services). For example, the "example.org" XMPP server might host a groupchat service at "chat.example.org". In order to accept XML stanzas from rooms at "chat.example.org" intended for addresses at "xmpp.example.com", the "xmpp.example.com" domain will need to validate the "chat.example.org" domain (just as it already did for the "example.org" domain). Thus the "example.org" server would now initiate a dialback negotiation with "xmpp.example.com" but specify the Originating Server as "chat.example.org".</p>
  <p class="" style="">However, because the "example.org" server already has a validated connection open to the Receiving Server ("xmpp.example.com"), it MAY send a &lt;db:result/&gt; element with the key to be validated for the new Originating Server ("chat.example.org") over the XML stream that has already been negotiated, rather than opening a new TCP connection and XML stream.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="example-43" id="example-43"></a>Example 43. Piggybacked Key</p><div class="indent"><pre>
O2R: &lt;db:result

     &lt;/db:result&gt;
  </pre></div>
  <p class="" style="">The Receiving Server SHOULD accept this &lt;db:result/&gt; element (as it did for the first &lt;db:result/&gt; element) and process it according to the rules already specified. If that process is successful, it would eventually result in sending of a &lt;db:result/&gt; element from the Receiving Server to the Originating Server.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="example-44" id="example-44"></a>Example 44. Piggybacked Result</p><div class="indent"><pre>
R2O: &lt;db:result
         from='xmpp.example.com'

     &lt;/db:result&gt;
  </pre></div>
  <p class="" style="">However, if the Receiving Server does not allow reuse of the existing connection, it MUST return an error of the following form to the Originating Server.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="example-45" id="example-45"></a>Example 45. Piggybacking Not Supported</p><div class="indent"><pre>

     &lt;/db:result&gt;
  </pre></div>
  <p class="" style="">Note: a &lt;db:result/&gt; element of type "error" MUST NOT be considered a stream error and therefore MUST NOT result in termination of the stream and the underlying TCP connection, which presumably is being used for sending XML stanzas from the Originating Server to the Receiving Server.</p>
  <p class="box" style="">Note Well: Use of the "error" value was unspecified in <span class="ref">RFC3920</span>.</p>
<h2>4.
       <a name="security" id="security">Security Considerations</a></h2>
  <p class="" style="">Server Dialback helps protect against domain spoofing, thus making it more difficult to spoof XML stanzas. It is not a mechanism for authenticating, securing, or encrypting streams between servers as is done via SASL and TLS, and results in weak verification of server identities only. Furthermore, it is susceptible to DNS poisoning attacks unless DNSSEC (see <span class="ref" style=""><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033">RFC 4033</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-id2266218">12</a>]) is used. Even if the DNS information is accurate, Server Dialback cannot protect against attacks where the attacker is capable of hijacking the IP address of the remote domain. Domains requiring robust security SHOULD use TLS and SASL. If SASL is used for server-to-server authentication, Server Dialback SHOULD NOT be used since it is unnecessary.</p>
