<h2>1.
       <a name="intro">Introduction</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) provides a solid, flexible foundation for a wide variety of applications on top of XMPP's core XML streaming technology. With the advancement of <span class="ref">XMPP Core</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596150">1</a>] and <span class="ref">XMPP IM</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596180">2</a>] within the Internet Standards Process, interest in building XMPP-based applications and extensions has accelerated even further. Unfortunately, not everyone who wants to build public or private XMPP extensions is familiar with the key design criteria that motivated the original developers of the Jabber technologies or that guide successful XMPP-based protocol design today. Thus there is value in attempting to translate the often-implicit knowledge held by long-time Jabber developers and protocol designers into more explicit policies and principles to which others can adhere.  [<a href="#nt-id2596019">3</a>] The end result of explicating &quot;The Jabber Way&quot; will hopefully be a wider and deeper understanding of good protocol design practices within the Jabber/XMPP community.</p>
<h2>2.
       <a name="guidelines">Guidelines</a>
</h2>
  <div class="indent">
<h3>2.1 <a name="xmpp">XMPP is Sacred</a>
</h3>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Background</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">When the <span class="ref">Jabber Software Foundation (JSF)</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596282">5</a>] submitted the <span style="font-weight: bold">XMPP Core</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">XMPP IM</span> specifications to the <span class="ref">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596316">6</a>], it ceded change control over the core XML streaming technology developed by the Jabber community. However, the JSF has reserved the right to define extensions to XMPP; furthermore, that right is not exclusive to the JSF, since anyone can define their own public or private extensions to XMPP. These extensions are usually in the form of structured XML data that is qualified by a unique namespace other than those currently reserved by the IETF or the JSF.</p>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Meaning</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">When we say that &quot;XMPP is Sacred&quot;, we mean that good protocol design must work within the context of XMPP and not require changes to the core protocols. For one thing, any such changes would need to be pursued within the IETF. Further, the core semantics most likely provide everything that a protocol designer needs. If you think that you need to define a new kind of top-level stanza (other than &lt;message/&gt;, &lt;presence/&gt;, and &lt;iq/&gt;) or a new value of the 'type' attribute for any stanza kind, then you probably need to think again. Use XMPP as a set of building blocks and don't modify the foundation when you are working on higher-level structures; instead, treat XMPP as a transport layer and build extensions on top of that layer. A further implication of respecting XMPP is using structured data formats (e.g., applications of <span class="ref">XML 1.0</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596390">7</a>] rather than binary or plaintext formats) whenever possible. Finally, as explained in <span style="font-weight: bold">XMPP Core</span>, the &lt;presence/&gt; stanza exists to broadcast network and communications availability only; for more advanced information publishing, use <span class="ref">Publish-Subscribe</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596206">8</a>].</p>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Examples</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">A good example of honoring the XMPP specifications is <span class="ref">Invisibility</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596253">9</a>]; while the Jabber community had informally defined &lt;presence type='invisible'/&gt; at one point, that protocol was abandoned in favor of an XMPP-compliant approach. Another example is <span class="ref">XHTML-IM</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2595886">10</a>], which re-uses <span class="ref">XHTML 1.0</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2595905">11</a>] (a structured format that shares with XMPP a common root in XML) rather than <span class="ref">Rich Text Format (RTF)</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2595924">12</a>] (an unstructured format that does not derive from XML). Further examples are the &quot;extended presence&quot; JEPS (see <span class="ref">Extended Presence Protocol Suite</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2595948">13</a>]), which are built on top of JEP-0060 rather than overloading the &lt;presence/&gt; stanza.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="indent">
<h3>2.2 <a name="simple">Keep Clients Simple</a>
</h3>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Background</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">Almost all Jabber technologies are implemented in a client-server architecture. While that's not necessary (and there do exist some peer-to-peer applications of XMPP), it usually makes good sense. Among other things, a client-server architecture has enabled the Jabber community to force most of the complexity onto servers and components, thus keeping clients relatively simple. This principle has served the Jabber community well since the very beginning, and forms an important basis for further innovation.</p>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Meaning</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">The principle of &quot;keep clients simple&quot; has many implications, among them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't multiply protocols beyond necessity (the more protocols you define, the harder it is to write a client).</li>
      <li>Degrade gracefully so that simpler or older clients can still participate in the network.</li>
      <li>If intensive processing is required, make a server or component do it.</li>
      <li>Don't force additional requirements (such as XSLT processors) onto clients unless absolutely necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Examples</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">One good example of keeping clients simple is the presence stanza: the client has only to send &lt;presence/&gt; and the server takes care of presence probes, broadcasts, and appropriate routing decisions. Another example is <span class="ref">Multi-User Chat</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602305">14</a>]: although the protocol involves some complexity, it was written so that older clients can join and participate in MUC rooms even if they don't understand the more advanced MUC extensions.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="indent">
<h3>2.3 <a name="reuse">Re-Use Existing Protocols</a>
</h3>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Background</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">The Jabber community has been developing wire protocols for XML streaming, presence, and instant messaging since 1999. In that time, members of the community have defined a number of building blocks that can be used as the basis for further development. Furthermore, many smart people have created open protocols within other standards development organizations, including the IETF, the <span class="ref">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602269">15</a>], <span class="ref">OASIS</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602294">16</a>], the <span class="ref">International Telecommunication Union (ITU)</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602416">17</a>], and the <span class="ref">Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602441">18</a>].</p>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Meaning</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">Good protocol designers &quot;stand on the shoulders of giants&quot; by re-using protocols that have been defined within the JSF and within other standards development organizations. That does not mean we don't define new protocols, because sometimes that is necessary. However, we are aware of work completed by others and we make use of it, especially when that work is outside the Jabber community's core competence areas (e.g., security or multimedia data formats rather than XML streaming, presence, and real-time messaging). Furthermore, the JSF prefers to re-use open protocols wherever possible.</p>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Examples</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">Examples of re-using existing Jabber protocols include <span class="ref">Stream Initiation</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602379">19</a>] (which re-uses <span class="ref">Feature Negotiation</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602540">20</a>]) and <span style="font-weight: bold">JEP-0126: Invisibility</span> (which re-uses the privacy lists protocol defined in <span style="font-weight: bold">XMPP IM</span>). Examples of re-using non-Jabber protocols include <span class="ref">SOCKS5 Bytestreams</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602475">21</a>] (which makes use of <span class="ref">RFC 1928</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602496">22</a>]) and <span class="ref">Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) over XMPP</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602516">23</a>] (which defines a way to send <span class="ref">Common Alerting Protocol</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602632">24</a>] data via Jabber). Here again JEP-0071 provides an example: it re-uses XHTML 1.0 (an open protocol developed by a recognized standards development organization) rather than RTF (a closed protocol under the control of the Microsoft Corporation).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="indent">
<h3>2.4 <a name="modular">Modular is Better</a>
</h3>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Background</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">Most Jabber implementations are built using modular architectures, wherein pieces of functionality are coded as separate components and then assembled into larger wholes, with core routing logic that integrates the system (examples include clients that enable the development of plugins and servers that enable the attachment of external components). We can view many Jabber protocols the same way: each one specifies a well-defined domain of functionality that is loosely connected to other domains and integrated by the core transport layer provided by XMPP.</p>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Meaning</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">The best Jabber protocols are quite focused and provide limited but powerful functionality that can be applied in a specific domain or, sometimes, re-used by other Jabber protocols. Even if the domain is more complex, a protocol that addresses it needs to clearly define its scope, limit that scope as much as possible, and specify only the protocols necessary to meet the core requirements.</p>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Examples</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">
<span class="ref">Service Discovery</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602746">25</a>] and <span class="ref">Data Forms</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602766">26</a>] are good examples of focused, single-purpose protocols. By contrast, <span style="font-weight: bold">Multi-User Chat</span> is more complex, but it limits itself to the domain of text conferencing in the context of virtual rooms (e.g., it does not address service-level administration) and consists of separate namespaces for end-user, moderator, and room owner functionality. A good example of a protocol that is focused on a smaller domain is <span class="ref">Roster Item Exchange</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602681">27</a>].</p>
  </div>
  <div class="indent">
<h3>2.5 <a name="strengths">Know Your Strengths</a>
</h3>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Background</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">The core strength of Jabber technologies is the streaming of relatively small XML fragments between presence-aware network endpoints. As is usually the case, our greatest strength is also our greatest weakness. Thus XMPP is not optimized for binary data, large XML files, multimedia streaming, or other such applications.</p>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Meaning</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">It's not a bad thing that we don't solve the problems of exchanging binary data, transferring large files, or streaming multimedia, because other protocols and technologies have addressed those domains. But it's important to recognize what we do well and what we don't. For example, the average size of an XMPP stanza is probably on the order of 200 bytes, and in general the largest effective size for stanzas is perhaps ten times that large; although stanzas can be much larger than that, normally it is not wise to consistently generate larger stanzas, and applications that might depend on large stanzas would do better to communicate their data outside of the Jabber band.</p>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Examples</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">
<span class="ref">File Transfer</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602904">28</a>] is a good example of respecting the strengths and weaknesses of XMPP, since it specifies that going out of band is the preferred mechanism for bandwidth-heavy data transfers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="indent">
<h3>2.6 <a name="explicit">Be Explicit</a>
</h3>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Background</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">In the beginning was the code (mainly <span class="ref">jabberd</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602862">29</a>]). Although code is explicit in its own way, not everyone reads code, and detailed specifications are necessary in order to make functionality reproducible in different codebases. The Jabber community has learned that lesson the hard way.</p>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Meaning</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">Detailed, explicit specifications are good specifications. Define your terms. Use conformance terminology such as MUST and SHOULD rather than loose English words such as &quot;does&quot; and &quot;will&quot;. Follow the <span class="ref">Guidelines for JEP Authors</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2603012">30</a>]. Specify error conditions. Include lots of examples. Restrict the allowable XML via schemas and datatypes as specified in <span class="ref">XML Schema Part 1</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602938">31</a>] and <span class="ref">XML Schema Part 2</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602957">32</a>].</p>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Examples</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">
<span style="font-weight: bold">XMPP Core</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">XMPP IM</span> are large documents that define the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol in excruciating detail. Although such specifications are not fun to write, they provide a model for good protocol design and documentation.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="indent">
<h3>2.7 <a name="flexible">Stay Flexible</a>
</h3>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Background</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">The need for explicit definition must be balanced against the need for flexibility. A completely rigid protocol may break under stress or when conditions change, whereas a more flexible protocol may bend and adapt. Knowing when to be explicit and when to be flexible is a key to good protocol design.</p>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Meaning</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">In general, a protocol needs to define the skeleton of functionality, but not necessarily specific parameters or values to be used within a certain domain. In order to allow for growth and change, it often makes sense to specify that the <span class="ref">Jabber Registrar</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2603166">33</a>] shall keep track of certain parameters and values, rather than to explicitly limit them in the protocol itself.</p>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Examples</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">Whereas the old <span class="ref">Agent Information</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2603110">34</a>] and <span class="ref">Jabber Browsing</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2603131">35</a>] protocols defined certain hardcoded values for entity types and categories, <span style="font-weight: bold">Service Discovery</span> has left that function up to the Jabber Registrar. Similarly, <span class="ref">Stream Initiation</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2603145">36</a>] defines a registry for its profiles, <span class="ref">Advanced Message Processing</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2603281">37</a>] defines registries for processing conditions and actions, and a number of JEPs register FORM_TYPE values as specified in <span class="ref">Field Standardization for Data Forms</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2603207">38</a>].</p>
  </div>
  <div class="indent">
<h3>2.8 <a name="privacy">Privacy and Security Matter</a>
</h3>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Background</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">Since the beginning, privacy and security have been important priorities within the Jabber community. That must not change.</p>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Meaning</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">Good protocols respect the confidentiality of data generated or communicated by users and applications as well as the security of the system or network as a whole. Although privacy and security considerations have been dealt with at the core XMPP layer, application-level protocols must not compromise privacy and security. Attention to these matters, along with rigorous cross-area review and close scrutiny by protocol designers (in the form of the <span class="ref">Jabber Council</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2603388">39</a>] and <span class="ref">Standards JIG</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2603416">40</a>]), will help ensure that the protocols we develop will provide a strong foundation for communication over the Internet.</p>
    <p class="" style=""><span style="font-style: italic">Examples</span></p>
    <p class="" style="">As is well-known, the presence subscription model developed by the Jabber community and specified in <span style="font-weight: bold">XMPP IM</span> requires approval before a contact can view a user's presence. Similarly, Jabber has always included strong authentication methods, which have been further improved through the use of SASL (<span class="ref">RFC 2222</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2603342">41</a>]).</p>
  </div>
<h2>3.
       <a name="security">Security Considerations</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">There are no security features or concerns directly related to this proposal, which is informational in nature. However, as discussed above, protocols that are developed following these guidelines should appropriately address privacy and security considerations. Helpful guidelines for security in relation to Internet protocol design can be found in <span class="ref">RFC 3552</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2603527">42</a>].</p>
<h2>4.
